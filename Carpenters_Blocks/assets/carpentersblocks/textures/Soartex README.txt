This mod allows you to include additional graphics
options for beds, flowerpots, patterns, and overlays.
Only the higher-res versions of the default options
will show up by default. If you wish to use any
additional options, they need to be added to the mod
itself, and in order to show up properly in a
multiplayer game, all the players must have a mod
with the same options in the same number spots.

Some additional graphics have been included for those
who wish to use them. If you do not want them, they can
be safely deleted.

The Alts folder contains alternate versions of some of
the default blocks and items.

A bed with a Soartex-style blanket is included in the 
beds folder as design_101.

The base texture used for the flowerpots has been included
for those who want to make more designs using the same
basic look. Note that the middle four pixels (originally one
row) is used as both one of the sides of the top texture and
as the top of the side texture.

Additional high-res Patterns can be downloaded from the
Minecraft Forum thread for Carpenter's Blocks as of
January 2014.

Enjoy!
